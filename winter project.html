<center><p> Get the speed of toy die-cast cars!</p>
   <p> I'm sure all of us remember playing with toy cars at some point in our childhood, and maybe you even kept playing till today. 
    There's something inherently satisfying about seeing a scale car model zooming through a race track of your own design. </p>
 <p>However, It'd be a lot more satisfying if we had a tangible number of exactly how fast they were actually going, right?</p>
 <p>Thats where this project comes into play. Using a few electronic components, we can accurately measure the car's velocity on a given piece of track.</p> </center>

<h2> <center> <u> Construction </u> </center> </h2>
 <center> <p> This circuit works by Measuring the distance we want to cover and timing how long it takes the car to cross this distance via 2 passage sensors. </p>
    <p> This data gives us enough to calcuate the cars speed via simple formula. This number is then shown on a nearby LED screen for easy viewing. </p>
    <p> The construction of this mechanism is fairly simple, and putting it together is farily enjoyable. </p></center>
